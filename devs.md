# Devs
This file is for the devs of the game. It has info on some dev-things.
## Contributing
Before you do anything, you should probably tell the rest of the devs what you're going to do so work doesn't get messed up. If you're using a local git client, make sure your local repo is up to date. If you're making changes that need to be tested, aka pretty much anything regarding changing code, make a new Godot project (or update your old one), replace its contents with the current repo, and test your changes there. Once you've tested and everything, commit the changes and open a pull request, and I'll merge it in (assuming it isn't something like "replace entire folder with 'cheetos.txt'" (though that would be pretty funny)).
